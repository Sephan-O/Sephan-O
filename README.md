- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sephan-O, a certified AWS cloud practicioner fluent in HTML, CSS, MySQL and comfortable in javascript and php. I'm also good in UI/UX design using figma and adhere to SEO best practices while developing a site.
- 👀 I’m interested in and eager for opportunities that can help me develop deeper understanding of front end frameworks and testing in addition to rest API integration. It would be ‼️highly appreciable to land an AMP and MERN or a genral software dev mentor‼️. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack while trying to hone my UI/UX skills on figma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on react.js projects
- 📫 You can reach me at: <ogolas.otn@gmail.com>
